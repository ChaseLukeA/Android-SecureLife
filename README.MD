#SecureLife
##An Android project supporting API 11 through API 22.

###About
This is my final project for my Android Development class. This is an app I built from the ground up that is "dedicated to keeping all of your online and offline accounts' information secure."
I currently save all my important information in an Excel spreadsheet and wanted a nice convenient way to save all that data to an SQLite database and access from my phone instead.

###Details
I'm using AppCompat v7 for supporting ActionBar, Toolbar, etc all the way from Android Lollipop back to Gingerbread 2.3.6.
